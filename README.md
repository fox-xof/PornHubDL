## Project Overview

This is a Chrome extension designed for research and learning purposes, allowing users to extract and download Pornhub videos.  
**Disclaimer**: This project is intended for educational and research use only. The author is not responsible for any commercial or illegal activities.

## Background

Previously, I noticed that some developers had created similar Chrome extensions, but many of them are no longer maintained.  
As we all know, with new Chrome extension updates, certain syntax and API requirements have changed, causing older extensions to stop working.  
This project was created to maintain compatibility with the latest Chrome standards, making it convenient for learning and research.

## Usage

1. Load the extension in Chrome (enable Developer Mode and load the folder containing `manifest.json`).  
2. Open a Pornhub video page and click the extension icon to display the available video list.  
3. Click the "Download" button to directly download MP4 videos, or click the "HLS Link" button to copy the link to your clipboard.  

**Note**: This extension is for learning and research only. Do not use it for commercial or illegal purposes.
